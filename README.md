# SimonSaysGame

A game of growing sequence callback. Like the game Simon, four buttons play back an ever increasing pattern, requiring the player to remember the sequence and play it back each round.

# Features
- Difficulty levels: Standard difficulty plays back the sequence at a constant speed while Hard difficulty increases speed as the player succeeds
- High score tables (future): Both difficulty levels have a high score table, tracking players who reached the highest sequence length
- Configurations: Allows the player to choose between mouse and keyboard input dynamically, and configure the keyboard keys (arrow/WASD) prior to game play
- Sound playback (future): Uses sounds attached to each note. Player can use custom sounds as well.
